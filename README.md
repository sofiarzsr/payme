payme was designed for self-hosting in a homelab environment. Run it on a Raspberry Pi, NAS, or any always-on server to track your household finances privately without relying on third-party services. Your financial data stays on your network, under your control.

I grew tired of my spreadsheet, and did not care for any of the third party services out there. So I decided to build my own. As such, you can see this is very opinionated. If you don't like it, fork it and make it your own or consider contributing to the project (read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information).

## Requirements

- Rust 1.75+
- Node.js 20+
- SQLite3

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
cargo build --release
```

Environment variables:
See `.env.example` for all available variables.

```bash 
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:payme.db?mode=rwc
JWT_SECRET=some-random-string
PORT=3001
``` 


## Running both services

The `run.sh` script starts both the backend and frontend simultaneously for local development:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This launches:
- Backend at http://localhost:3001
- Frontend at http://localhost:3000

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both services.

You can obviously run the backend and frontend separately if you want to by navigating to the respective directories and running the commands there.

## Database

SQLite database created at `backend/payme.db`. Tables auto-migrate on startup.

Export/import database via the UI download button or `/api/export` endpoint.

## Docker

Docker is the recommended way to deploy payme in a homelab. The multi-stage build creates a minimal image with just the compiled binary and static frontend assets.

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Set a secure JWT secret
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env

# Build and start
docker compose up -d
```

Access payme at http://your-ip:3001

### Manual Docker Build

```bash
docker build -t payme .
docker run -d \
  --name payme \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v payme_data:/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key \
  payme
```

### Data Persistence

The SQLite database is stored in a Docker volume at `/data`. To backup:

```bash
docker cp payme:/data/payme.db ./backup.db
```

### Reverse Proxy

For production, place payme behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with HTTPS. Example nginx config:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name finance.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
